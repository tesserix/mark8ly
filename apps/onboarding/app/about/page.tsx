            How We Started
          </h2>
          <div className="prose prose-lg text-foreground-secondary">
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              We built mark8ly because we saw too many talented people
              struggling with the same problem: they had amazing products but
              couldn&apos;t afford the expensive platforms, transaction fees,
              and developers needed to sell online.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              We knew there had to be a better way. So we created a platform
              that&apos;s powerful enough for growth, simple enough to set up
              in an afternoon, and fair enough that you keep more of what you
              earn.

            big brands use—without the enterprise price tag.
